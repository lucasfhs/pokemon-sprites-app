![](./preview-project.gif)

Hello, I'm excited to introduce you to one of my projects!

The project uses Vue 2 with Vue CLI to create a Pokémon sprite viewer by connecting to 'https://pokeapi.co/'. The idea is to quickly retrieve Pokémon sprites to assist in the potential development of a game or similar projects.

```
